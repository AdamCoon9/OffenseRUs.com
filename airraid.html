        <h1>The Air Raid Offense</h1>
        <div class="container"><img src="images/Air Raid/Mesh.png" alt="The mesh play. A staple of the air raid offense"> </div>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>The term "air raid offense" in American football refers to an offensive scheme that was made popular by coaches at Iowa Wesleyan University, Valdosta State, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas Tech, Louisiana Tech, and Washington State, respectively, including Mike Leach, Hal Mumme, Sonny Dykes, and Tony Franklin.
            The setup for the system calls for one running back and four wide receivers in a shotgun configuration. With two outside receivers and two inside slot receivers, the formations are a version of the run and shoot offensive. Trips formations, with three wide receivers on one side of the field and one receiver on the other, are another tactic used by the offense.
        </p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>When Mumme and Leach took over at Iowa Wesleyan College and Valdosta State University, the offense made its debut and was successful in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The University of Kentucky provided the initial introduction to NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) in 1997. There, quarterback Tim Couch became a unanimous All-American in 1998 and the first overall choice of the NFL draft thanks to the guidance of head coach Hal Mumme and assistant coach Mike Leach. In 1999, Leach moved on to become the offensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma before being hired as Texas Tech's head coach. 
            Assistant coaches, like Chris Hatcher at Valdosta State, Art Briles at Houston and Baylor, Sonny Dykes at Louisiana Tech and California, Ruffin McNeill at East Carolina, Dana Holgorsen at West Virginia, and Kevin Sumlin at Houston and Texas A&M, began to take on head coaching positions shortly after the early 2000s. The offense was also run by former Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury, who was Mike Leach's first quarterback at Texas Tech. Air Raid quarterbacks made up seven of the ten college players with the highest career passing percentages as of 2016—all of them were over 68.6 percent.

<div id="system">
    <h2>The System</h2>
    <p>Since passing plays account for 65–75% of offensive plays, the strategy stands out for its emphasis on passing. Depending on what the defensive team displays to him at the line of scrimmage, the quarterback is free to alter the play, known as an audible. Up to 90% of the run plays that were called during a season were selected by audible at the line of scrimmage in at least one instance.
        This offense, sometimes referred to as the No-huddle offense, relies heavily on the offense not huddleing. The moment the previous play concludes, the offensive advances to the line of scrimmage. After assessing what the defense is displaying, the quarterback promptly initiates the following play. Most of the time, the quarterback makes the decisions about audible play calls. In addition to enabling a team to rally from a significant deficit, the fast-paced offensive wears down the opposition and throws them off balance by limiting player replacements.
        The placement, or split, of the offensive linemen is a crucial component of the air raid offense. Linemen are often spaced out between half and full yards in an air raid offense, as opposed to being very densely bunched together in a traditional approach. Though this should make it simpler to create blitz lanes, it makes defensive ends and defensive tackles run farther to get to the quarterback and take a sack. The short, fast passes neutralize any potential blitz. Another benefit is that the quarterback has wider than usual passing lanes to throw through, which lowers the likelihood of the pass being intercepted or knocked down. This is achieved by forcing the defensive line to broaden.
        The main goals of an air raid play are to quickly remove the ball from the quarterback's hands, spread out the defense thinly in all directions, and give the quarterback the opportunity to focus on a single defensive player who must choose which receiver to cover in his designated area. Although zone coverages are the usual target for air raid plays, they also function effectively against man-to-man defenses because air raid offenses frequently use receivers who are faster than average, giving them an edge in man-to-man coverage.

           <li>"Throw short as many times as possible to people who can score as many times as possible.”
            -Hal Mumme</li> 
            <li>“There’s nothing balanced about the 50 percent run, 50 percent pass because that’s 50 percent stupid. When you have five skill positions, if all five of them are contributing to the offensive effort, then that’s balanced. But this notion that if you hand it to one guy 50 percent of the time and you throw it to a combination of two guys 50 percent and you’re really balanced, then you proudly pat yourself on the back and tell yourself that… Well then you’re delusional.”
                -Mike Leach</li>
            <li>“The Air Raid Offense is just a philosophy of what we do. It’s a philosophy of being simple, of having an identity, putting players in a position to be successful and letting them go. It’s an execution based philosophy. We try to take the thinking out of it for the players and I think that’s really important. As a player if you’re overthinking things or something is unclear to you you can see it in speed of play. They are playing slow or hesitating. We’re going to try to take all hesitation out of the players, let them free, let them use their abilities”

            <P>Though it's not called as frequently as other plays, the 93 or H wheel might be useful if the perfect situation arises. This play depends on the curl's depth, which makes it potentially challenging. At least fifteen yards must be covered in the curl. A shorter curl indicates that the quarterback's throwing window is constrained. The QB takes a long time to make his reads, thus protection is crucial.</P>

            <p>94 is a useful idea in the Air Raid toolbox. This idea is sometimes misinterpreted as a sail or flood idea, however it is actually a deep out vertical idea.

    <p>The Air Raid offense's base four verticals play is designated as "6". This play is very flexible; you can adjust it to whatever the defense gives you at any time.
     Because tags can be called on any play, "6" is seen as a rapid passing play. Individual coaches are free to experiment with tags to find strategies that work for them. 
        </p>
        <h4>Mandatory Outside Release</h4>
        <p>The mandatory outside release requirement applies to all receivers. To get their opponent to flip their hips and turn their head, all receivers must release on the outside of them. This play works well against man-to-man and pushed corners.</p>
        <h4>Dropout Rules</h4>
        <p>The principles that all receivers follow when running their routes are known as dropout rules. In essence, you will proceed vertically into the deep part of the field if you are "uncapped" or uncovered. The receiver will "drop out" or "break off" of their route if they are "capped". This occurs roughly ten yards away from the ball. The receiver will veer off course if he doesn't believe he can "get over the top" or beat his man vertical. This appears to be a curve or halt of ten yards. Outside receivers break out toward the sideline, while inside receivers break in. </p>
        <h4>2x2 Rules</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Each rules is depends on leverage</li>

            <h2>Screens</h2>
            <p>An essential component of the Air Raid offensive are screens. With blockers in front of them, screens are a wonderful way to get the ball to a player outside the numbers. Though I believe that's a mistake, coaches have been known to cling onto their screens until extended down and distance situations. Screens should be used frequently, even if they don't function at first. Furthermore, if you are having trouble integrating outside receivers into the scheme, these screens are a simple method to get the ball to them.</p>
